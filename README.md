# Tic-Tac-Toe Minimax AI

This project is a web-based implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, enhanced with a sophisticated AI opponent that uses the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning. The AI is designed to provide a challenging opponent by efficiently evaluating possible moves and making optimal decisions.

#### Key Features:
- **AI Opponent**: Play against a computer AI that uses the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for optimal gameplay.
- **Randomized Starting Player**: The starting player is chosen randomly at the beginning of each game to ensure varied gameplay experiences.
- **Interactive UI**: A user-friendly interface with a responsive game board and pop-up notifications for game results.
- **Game Reset**: Easily reset the game and start over with a new randomized starting player.
- **Efficient Performance**: The use of alpha-beta pruning in the AI logic reduces unnecessary calculations, making the AI faster and more efficient.

#### How to Play:
- Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to start the game.
- Click on the cells to make your move. The AI will automatically respond with its move.
- The game will display the result (win, lose, draw) in a pop-up at the end.
- Use the "Reset Game" button in the pop-up to start a new game with a randomized starting player.

#### Technical Details:
- **HTML/CSS**: Provides the structure and styling for the game interface.
- **JavaScript**: Implements the game logic, including the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for the AI.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures the game is playable on various devices and screen sizes.

This project showcases the integration of advanced AI techniques into a simple yet engaging game, offering both entertainment and a demonstration of algorithmic efficiency.
